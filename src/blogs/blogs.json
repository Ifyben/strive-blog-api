Today, I would like to share with you some beauty blog post ideas that will hopefully help you out if you ever happen to hit a creative block. I think that it's only natural to feel a lack of inspiration from time to time, especially if you've been blogging for a while. Whenever I feel creative, I like to write down any blog post ideas that come to mind in a little notebook, and use them later on. There is an endless amount of things that you can talk about as a beauty blogger, so I've compiled a list of some of my go-to ideas. This includes everything from makeup, skincare to lifestyle post ideas - I really hope that you find them useful!</p></div>","cover":"http://placeholder.it/800x800","author":{"name":"Ify Azubuike","avatar":"https://ifyazubuike.com/avatar.png","email":"//ifechukwu.azubuike@gmail.com"},"readTime":{"value":1,"unit":"minute"},"createdAt":"2022-09-12T22:10:09.376Z","updatedAt":"2022-09-12T22:10:09.376Z"}]
