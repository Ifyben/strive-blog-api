## You are in charge of creating a set of WebAPIs for the Strive Blog application.

## Here you can find the Frontend already created

 

## In this first "step" the application should enable the creation, editing, deletion, listing of blog authors.

 

## Tomorrow you will connect to your backend from the frontend that we provided and communicate with your own API.

 

 

## Authors should have the following information:

 

## name
## surname
## ID (Unique and server-generated)
## email
## date of birth
## avatar (e.g. https://ui-avatars.com/api/?name=John+Doe)
 

## The backend should include the following routes:

 

## GET /authors => returns the list of authors
## GET /authors/123 => returns a single author
## POST /authors => create a new author
## PUT /authors/123 => edit the author with the given id
## DELETE /authors/123 => delete the author with the given id

## Strive Blog API
 

## You are in charge of creating a set of WebAPIs for the Strive Blog application.

## Here you can find the Frontend already created

 
## In this second "step" the application should enable the creation, editing, deletion, listing of blog posts


## Blog posts should contain the following information:

 
## {	
## "_id": "SERVER GENERATED ID",
## "category": "ARTICLE CATEGORY",
## "title": "ARTICLE TITLE",
## "cover":"ARTICLE COVER (IMAGE LINK)",
## "readTime": {
##  "value": 2,
##  "unit": "minute"
##  },
## "author": {
##     "name": "AUTHOR AVATAR NAME",
##     "avatar":"AUTHOR AVATAR LINK"
##     },
##  "content":"HTML",
##  "createdAt": "NEW DATE"
## }
 

## Backend
 

## The backend should include the following routes:

 

## GET /blogPosts => returns the list of blogposts
## GET /blogPosts /123 => returns a single blogpost
## POST /blogPosts => create a new blogpost
## PUT /blogPosts /123 => edit the blogpost with the given id
## DELETE /blogPosts /123 => delete the blogpost with the given id
 

## The persistence must be granted via file system (es.: Json file with a list of blog posts inside)

 

## Sidenote: remember to install the cors package with 'npm i cors', to import it and to use it with 'server.use(cors())'

 

## ⚠️ Bodies, params and queries must be validated

## ⚠️ Needed error handlers must be added (and properly used)

 

## Frontend
 

## Post article from new article form
## Fetch & List your articles at home page


## Extra Features
## GET /authors/:id/blogPosts/ => get all the posts for an author with a given ID
## GET /blogPosts?title=whatever => filter the blogposts and extract the only that match the condition (es.: title contains "whatever")
## Add search feature to frontend 


## ******************************* Day 4 ****************************************

## Strive Blog API - 3


## You are in charge of creating a set of WebAPIs for the Strive Blog application.

## Here you can find the Frontend already created



##  In this third "step" the application should enable file uploading and comments crud



##  Backend
##  Comments are going to be embedded in the corresponding blog post, so add a comments array on every post (empty at ##  the beginning). They should contain just author name and text



## The backend should include the following routes:

## POST /authors/:id/uploadAvatar, uploads a picture (save as idOfTheAuthor.jpg in the public/img/authors folder) for ## the author specified by the id. Store the newly created URL into the corresponding author in authors.json
## POST /blogPosts/:id/uploadCover, uploads a picture (save as idOfTheBlogPost.jpg in the public/img/blogPosts folder) ## for the blog post specified by the id. Store the newly created URL into the corresponding post in blogPosts.json
## GET /blogPosts/:id/comments, get all the comments for a specific post
## POST /blogPosts/:id/comments, add a new comment to the specific post




## The persistence must be granted via file system



## Configure Express to use the public folder to serve static files





## FRONTEND
## The user should be able to upload a picture as an avatar
## The user should be able to upload a picture as a blog post cover






## Extra Features
## BE: Comments edit and delete
## FE: Post new comment on a blog post





## *************************************** Day 7 *************************************************

## Complete all the homeworks from last week (including extras 😜), then deploy it on cloud.


## ☁️ CLOUD
## We want to make applications available for the general public and production ready 🚗⚡



## Deploy everything on HEROKU and VERCEL, with CLOUDINARY as CDN



## ⚠️ If you have troubles with running on heroku remind to configure start scripts in package.json

## ⚠️ ⚠️ Remind to use environment variables both locally and remotely

## ⚠️ ⚠️ ⚠️ Configure CORS properly to make them work together.






## ************************************ Day 8 ****************************************************

## BACKEND

## [EXTRA] add blogpost image to PDF too
 

## You can find an example blog post as pdf in attachment.
 

## FRONTEND
## Create an anchor tag on single blog post page to permit PDF download
